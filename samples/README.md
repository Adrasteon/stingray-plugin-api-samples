# AutodeskÂ® Stingray / Stingray Plugin API engine samples

Here you'll find sample plugins with pre-generated Visual Studio 11 solution files. There are also batch files to re-generate the solution files if you have CMake installed. CMake is not required to use the samples.

The solutions files are located in a subfolder to each plugin: *build/vc11/win32/* and *build/vc11/win64/*.

* **CMakeUtils.txt** Helper file for CMake used by all plugin samples.

* **generate_all.bat** Re-generates the Visual Studio 11 32 and 64 bit solutions for all the samples in this folder.

* **generate_vc11.bat** Re-generates the Visual Studio 11 32 and 64 bit solutions for a single plugin (specified by folder name).
